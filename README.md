# Simple Alternate Language for MultiSites WP

# Description 

Simple Alternate Language for MultiSite WP (or SALMSWP for short...) allows you to add the alternate language page for your
content as follows:

<link rel="alternate" hreflang="es" href="http://es.example.com/" />

This will help you to fulfill the latest google "requirements" for multilingual sites on multisite wordpress installations,
on which there is no "easy" way to relate post/pages from one language to another
